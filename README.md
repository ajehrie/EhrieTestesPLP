# TestesPLP
Raw Materials for AJP Manuscript

For this project we tested whether parallel laser photogrammetry could be used to precisley capture biologically relevant external testes size, using the mantled howler monkey as our study system. Data was collected during the summer of 2022 at La Selva Biological Station in Costa Rica. Our manuscript was submitted to the American Journal of Primatology the fall of 2023. This repository includes excel data files, R scripts, and photos.
